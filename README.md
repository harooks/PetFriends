# PetFriends

This app allows users to store information about your pet's friends!

First time users would need to create an account from their email, password, and their pet's information. 
Users have to reenter credentials only if they logout. Each account is for a household, so they share a login to manage the pets they have.

The app has one big table for all your pet's friends. Users can add pet's friends by pressing the add button, and inputting their images, names, breed, allergies, and other information you want. 
Users can also bookmark pets that your pet is good friends with, and filter them in the list.
